## About The Project

As part of my son's collegiate math class, he wanted to create a variation of a [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) where the triangles grew outside of the primary triangle rather than being nested within it. We couldn't figure out a programmatic solution before the due date of the project, so he wound up having to draw it by hand.

Some weeks later, I decided to attack the problem as a side-research project to expand my skillset a bit. After a few weeks of beating my head against the keyboard, things finally fell into place, and I was able to generate the same image my son drew by hand. Then, of course, I had to add some features to make it fun to play with.
